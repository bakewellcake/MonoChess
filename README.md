# MonoChess

A small chess game I have built in my spare time with two playable options - human vs computer and human vs human. This is my first attempt at artificial intelligence so it won't be the smartest player. I originally started this in XNA but sadly that is no longer viable so I've continued the project in Mono, hence the name of the project.
